function    [Samp, Sph, EjeF] = spctr(s, FreqRes, SampFreq, FreqRange)
%
%  [Samp, Sph, EjeF] = spctr(s, FreqRes, SampFreq, FreqRange);
% spctr Computes the spectral amplitude and phase
% of a signal or matrix of signals 's' based on fft transform.
% if 's' is a 2D or 3D matrix, fourier proceed on each column independently.
%
% NOTE!! Asumes that there are more points than independent signals!!
%
% Input variables
%
%     s        : signal or matrix of signals.
%
%    FreqRes   : Frequency resolution in Hz/bin. eg 2 means 2 Hz in one bin, 
%              and 0.5 means  0.5 Hz per bin.
%
%    SampFreq  : Sampling frequency in Hz.
%
%    FreqRange : range of frequencies to be analized eg [10 : 50]
%
% Output Variables
%
%     Samp    : Spectral amplitude of signal 's'
%
%     Sph     : Spectral phase of signal 's'
%
%     EjeF    : axis of analized frequencies. Each element of this vector contains 
%               the central frequency corresponding to each analized bin.
